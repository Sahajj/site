<p>As a beginner in computer networks, you may be overwhelmed by all the technical jargon and complex concepts. But don&rsquo;t worry, once you understand the basics, computer networks are actually quite simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with the most important concept: what is a computer network? Simply put, a computer network is a group of computers that are connected to each other for the purpose of sharing resources. These resources can include things like data, printers, and internet connections.</p>

</h3><p>The history of computer networks is a long and complicated one. It started with the first computer networks in the 1950s, which were used to connect computers in a single building or on a single campus.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, these early computer networks were connected together to form what we now call the Internet. The Internet was originally designed as a way for scientists to share data and research findings with each other.</p>

</span>
</h3><p>The timeline for the development of computer networks is long and complex, with many key milestones and innovations. Here is a brief overview of some of the most significant events in the history of computer networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>1933: **Telex messaging network comes on-line —&gt;**Like the Volkswagen Beetle and modern freeway systems, the Telex messaging network comes out of the early period of Germany’s Third Reich. Telex starts as a way to distribute military messages, but soon becomes a worldwide network of both official and commercial text messaging that will persist in some countries into the 2000s. Telex uses teleprinters, which date back to the 1910s for use in telegraphy. But instead of using pricey dedicated telegraph lines, the telex system connects those teleprinters to each other over voice telephone lines, routed by modified telephone switches. Wireless versions of Telex soon connect remote regions of the developing world.</li>
<li>1934:Belgian Paul Otlet has a modest goal: collect, organize, and share all the world’s knowledge. Otlet had co-created a massive “search engine” starting in the early 1900s. His Mundaneum now combines enhanced card catalogs with sixteen million entries, photos, documents, microfilm, and more. He is working on integrating telegraphy and multiple media, from sound recordings to television. These approaches to organizing information differ. But all share key features of today’s Web, including automated cross-references – <strong>which we call Hyperlinks.</strong></li>
<li>1948: The first recorded proposal for a global computer network is made by computer scientist Paul Otlet, who envisions a &ldquo;mechanical, collective brain&rdquo; that would be capable of storing and sharing vast amounts of information.</li>
<li>1949: Birth of The Modem —&gt;Computers “talk” over ordinary voice phone lines through modems. Developed in 1949 for transmitting radar signals by Jack Harrington’s group at the Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC) near Boston, the modem modulates digital data into sounds and demodulates received sounds into digital data. (MODulation + DEModulation = MODEM). Modems will be adapted to computers in 1953 for the upcoming SAGE system and commercialized by Bell Telephone in 1958. By letting computers use normal voice telephone lines, they offer greater coverage and lower costs than dedicated telegraph or leased data lines.</li>
<li>1957: The Soviet Union launches Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, which sparks interest in the United States in creating a global network of computers to track the satellite&rsquo;s orbit and other space-related data.</li>
<li>1962: J.C.R. Licklider, a pioneer in the field of computer science, publishes a paper called &ldquo;On-Line Man-Computer Communication,&rdquo; which outlines his vision for a global network of interconnected computers.</li>
<li>1969: The first two nodes of the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, are connected at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).</li>
<li>1972: The first email is sent over the ARPANET, marking the start of a new era of digital communication.</li>
<li>1973: The first international connections to the ARPANET are established, linking the network to research institutions in the United Kingdom and Norway.</li>
<li>1976: Queen Elizabeth II sends the first royal email, marking the first time a head of state has used email.</li>
<li>1977: The first internet service provider (ISP) is established, allowing individuals to access the internet from their own computers.</li>
<li>1983: The Domain Name System (DNS) is introduced, allowing users to access the internet using more user-friendly domain names instead of complex numerical IP addresses.</li>
<li>1990: The World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee, is made publicly available, making it much easier for users to access and share information online.</li>
<li>1993: The first widely used web browser, Mosaic, is released, making the internet more accessible to the general public.</li>
<li>1995: Amazon, the first major e-commerce company, is founded, marking the start of a new era of online shopping.</li>
<li>1998: Google is founded, becoming the world&rsquo;s most popular search engine and one of the most influential companies in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This timeline is by no means exhaustive, and there are many other important events and milestones in the history of computer networks. The field continues to evolve and change rapidly, with new developments and innovations being constantly introduced.</p>

</h3><p><em>—</em></p>
<p><em>The development of computer networks can be traced back to the late 1940s. In 1947, John von Neumann, a mathematician and computer scientist, published a paper on this subject. He envisioned that computer networks would eventually replace the traditional paper-based communications system.</em></p>
<p><em>In 1951, Leonard Kleinrock developed the mathematical theory of packet networks while working at MIT. He is often referred to as &ldquo;the father of packet switching.&rdquo; Packet switching is a key technology that enables data communication over a network. It is used in most computer networks in the world today.</em></p>
<p><em>Packet switching is a method of distributing data over a network. The process of packet switching involves breaking information into small segments of data known as packets and then reassembling them when received at the destination.</em></p>
<p><img src="A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Computer%20Networks%20(Draft%20one)%20e5dada7af2ef46618eac6dbe54fb0468/packet-switching.png" alt="packet-switching.png"></p>
<p><em>Packet switching helps prevent any small bits of information from having to wait until the larger bit of information is sent. When information is broken into packets, packet size and speed of the line determine how long it takes packets to travel to their destination.</em></p>

</h3><p>People have been communicating long before the invention of the telephone. The first use of a network was a telegraph system that was built in 1844. Telegraphs were used to send messages over long distances using wires that were strung along poles. The telegraph system is an example of what we call a <strong>point-to-point network</strong> because it only connects two points.</p>
<p>The telephone played an important role in the development of networks. This device would eventually replace the telegraph system and allowed for communication between more than just two people at one time. With the invention of this new device, networks became known as point-to-multipoint networks because they connect many points together to communicate with each other.</p>
